## Why You Need a Firewall

Firewalls are there to restrict the number of TCP / UDP ports to the minimize attack surface of a computer system or
network of computer systems.

They are often used to limit source IP addresses to ensure some services can only be accessed from known good sites
(this is something that public websites cannot do obviously).

Most firewalls are stateful tracking TCP session creation and responses to protect against obvious protocol abuse DoS
attacks like syn flooding.

## Hardware vs Software Firewalls

Hardware firewalls are more expensive as they are invariably proprietary.

Software firewalls are often packaged with Operating Systems, but at industrial level usually only unix-based software
firewalls are used to protect other systems, most notably the widely used [Linux IPtables](#linux-iptables).

## Host vs Network Firewalls

Technically all firewalls operate on the same TCP/IP networking stack,
but some are more focused on protecting only their own computer host,
while others are routinely used
to protect other computer systems when using the host as a router forwarding packets acros the network.

Linux's IPtables is widely used for this purpose
and forms the basis of many cheaper appliances built on Linux such as [Smoothwall](#smoothwall).
