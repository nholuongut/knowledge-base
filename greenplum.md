- several high profile customers, BUT
- difficult to tune
- wanted all available system resources
- instability with concurrent queries
- tried queues, but not dynamic enough for real usage, acquired NoreVRP for dynamic database config but was hard to configure
- Barclays discovered Greenplum actually slowed down with disk cache as it expected to do full table disk scans for each query
- other customers discovered under high write load it caused Linux journalling errors that required rebuilding the DB (a 2 day process)
- competition from Hadoop, Hive, Impala
- Pivotal tried creating Hawq (Greenplum on HDFS) to counter, but proprietary format rendered use of HDFS pointless
- March 2015 open sourced Greenplum amid flood of open source RFPs
- development likely to stagnate as open source community fails to pick it up
- legacy technology
