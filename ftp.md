# FTP

An old protocol for file transfers.

You shouldn't use this normally, except some companies may use it for anonymous uploads for vendor support cases,
eg. [Informatica](informatica.md).

## FTP Clients

### GUI

- [Filezilla](https://filezilla-project.org/)
- [CyberDuck](https://cyberduck.io/)

### Command Line

The `ftp` command is provided by several packages

- GNU [inetutils](https://www.gnu.org/software/inetutils/)
  - on [Mac](mac.md) `brew install inetutils`
- [lftp](https://lftp.yar.ru/) - more sophisticated - bookmarking, tab completion
  can transfer several files in parallel
  - on [Mac](mac.md) `brew install lftp`
- [ncftp](https://www.ncftp.com/ncftp/) -  - more sophisticated - bookmarking, tab completion
  can transfer several files in parallel
  - on [Mac](mac.md) `brew install inetutils`
- curl - `curl -u user:password ftp://ftp.example.com/file.txt -O`
  - built-in on Mac, usually the `curl` package on most Linux distributions
- [tnftp](https://cdn.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/misc/tnftp/)

## FTP Servers

- [proftpd](http://www.proftpd.org/)

## FTP Client Commands

Usually as simple as:

```shell
ftp <host.domain.com>
```

and then using a series of FTP commands to put or get files inside the FTP shell.

Many of these will be familiar to unix command line users.
