## Client Apps Using Proxies

Use Cases:

- egress traffic to the internet from corporate networks for security controls and auditing - typical in banking
  (I've [worked](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nholuong) for several large well known banks)

<!-- -->

- reverse proxies like [Squid](https://www.squid-cache.org/)

<!-- -->

- used by package managers and build tools to download programming language libraries eg. `mvn` for Java to pull from
  Maven Central, `pip` for Python to pull from PyPI etc.

<!-- -->

- [SSH tunnels in GCP](ssh-tunnelling.md#gcp) used by `kubectl` to access protected GKE clusters master control plane API

Many client apps use the following environment variables.

## Environment Variables - `https_proxy` / `no_proxy`

- `https_proxy` - tells applications using libraries like `libwww` to send the packets to this addresses to be
  forwarded
  on.

- `no_proxy` - comma separated list of domains / FQDNs to not use the proxy

You can use `HTTPS_PROXY` and `NO_PROXY` too but the lowercase variables have higher precedence for most applications,
except for Golang. See [here](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2021/01/27/we-need-to-talk-no-proxy/) for the rules
various apps and languages follow.

Set both uppercase and lowercase to be the same to avoid any nasty surprises.

```shell
export https_proxy=http://localhost:8080
export no_proxy="domain1.com,host.domain2.com"

export HTTPS_PROXY="$https_proxy"
export NO_PROXY="$no_proxy"
```

## Compile Apache HTTPd with Proxying

```shell
wget http://www.mirrorservice.org/sites/ftp.apache.org/httpd/httpd-2.2.14.tar.gz &&
wget http://www.apache.org/dist/httpd/httpd-2.2.14.tar.gz.md5 &&
md5sum -c httpd-2.2.14.tar.gz.md5 &&
tar zxvf httpd-2.2.14.tar.gz &&
cd httpd-2.2.14 &&
./configure --enable-proxy --enable-proxy-http --with-mpm=worker --prefix=/usr/local/apache-proxy &&
make &&
make install
```
