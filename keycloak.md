## Terminology

- Realm - grouping of users, groups, permissions and credentials
- Client - app requesting authentication and authorization from Keycloak. Tokens (JWT) can be shared between users
- Resource - a user-defined object within keycloak, can be something general like a full feature, or can be a more specific asset
- Authorization Scope - the scope of access on a resource (eg. read, write)
- Policy - a rule to assign Permissions to resources, by user/group/role. For ABAC, must use JavaScript policies
- Permissions - created to allow policies to grant access to resources - Affirmative, Consensus, or Unanimous policy decision making

## Kubernetes Config

## Azure AD integration

Create Enterprise App + App Registration as usual

Microsoft provider configuration resulted in `An internal server error has occurred` upon logouts so went with OIDC provider.

In the realm in the Keycloak UI:

- Configure
  - Identity Providers
     - Add Provider (top right)
       - OpenID Connect v1.0 (aka OIDC)
         - set Display Name to "Azure AD" (for convenience only)
         - Import from URL near bottom - paste URL from AAD App Registration's Overview - Endpoints button at top - OpenID Connect metadata document (half way down)
         - Client Authentication = "Client secret sent as post"
         - Client ID - paste the AAD app's Overview "Application (client) ID" - XXX: Note the client id is that of the App not that of the secret
         - Client Secret
            - in AAD App Reg go to Clients & Secrets
               - New client secret
                  - paste the Value into the Client Secret box
         - Copy the "Redirect URI" from the top of this page into the AAD app's Authentication page - Add a platform - Web - Redirect URIs
  - Authentication
    - "Identity Provider Redirector" line of the grid
      - Alternative
        - Actions
          - Config
            - Default Identity Provider = oidc (the reference to the provider created above)

### AAD user pre-provisioning to Keycloak

- dump out user attribute list from AAD to decide on attributes
- AAD attributes sync to Keycloak
