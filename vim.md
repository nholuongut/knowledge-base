## Key Points

- `vi` is the core editor available on every unix system
- basic knowledge of `vi` is a core skill for all unix / linux server administrators
- tonnes of plugins, highly extensible and widely used
- see my advanced [.vimrc](https://github.com/nholuongut/devops-bash-tools/blob/master/configs/.vimrc) for all
  sorts of trips & tricks, hotkey linting and building, plugins etc.

```shell
vim testfile.txt
```

Starts in command mode. Below are mostly commands to remember since everything in insert mode is typed out literally.

Commands can often be used together in shorthand combinations or prefixed with a number to repeat the operation
N times or for N lines.

Lowercase vs Capitals often do the opposite action / direction.

You can run the `vimtutor` command on unix or inside `vim` the command `:help tutor` to get an interactive tutorial.

## Shortcuts

| Keystrokes               | Description                                                                                                                                  |
